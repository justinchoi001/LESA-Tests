		<execute function="Type" locator1="PGTicket#NEW_COMMENT_FIELD" value1="There were twenty ships, one sent each year by the United Nations Office of Colonization. The first ship arrived in the planet. The captain, American Captain Dennis Kerry, hailed from Massachusetts and had been a Roman Catholic. Acknowledging his roots, he christened the planet Plymouth. His wife, Helen Wheeler, was also an American and came from Virginia. She had christened the first colony Jamestown, also in acknowledgement of her roots. The ship had made a safe landing and the colonists got to work. Some worked to take soil samples. Geologists and surveyors began to mark out the colony before the construction workers could begin to build the massive crystoplast dome. Once the survey was completed, they dismantled the ship. The ship's computer core was placed in an underground chamber. The shipâ€™s reactors had become the power plants for the colony. The rest of the ship had been dismantled so that they could serve as crew quarters. It had taken the colonists over ten months to build the dome, build some decent housing and buildings, including a town hall, but they had finished in time before the next colony ship arrived. Most of the buildings were made from local brick and wood, which was surprisingly hard but sturdy. The colony ship had two shuttles and they were used extensively to survey the surrounding area." />
